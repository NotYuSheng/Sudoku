- [x] A good Sudoku engine shall accept any "valid" number at the time of input (no duplicate in row, column and sub-grid), but signal a conflict whenever it is detected. Highlight the conflicting cells.
- [x] **Choice of puzzles and difficulty levels (e.g,, easy, intermediate, difficult).**
- [x] Create a menu bar for options such as "File" (~~"New Game"~~, "Reset Game", "Exit"), "Options", and "Help" (Use JMenuBar, JMenu, and JMenuItem classes).
- [x] Create a status bar (JTextField at the south zone of BorderLayout) to show the messages (e.g., number of cells remaining) (google "java swing statusbar").
- [x] Re-organize your codes. Apply your OO knowledge to factor out a class called GameBoard, which is a customized JPanel.

- [x] A side panel for command, display, strategy?
