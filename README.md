# Sudoku
OOP Java Sudoku

*~~Reset/Restart the game.~~
*A good Sudoku engine shall accept any "valid" number at the time of input (no duplicate in row, column and sub-grid), but signal a conflict whenever it is detected. Highlight the conflicting cells.
***Choice of puzzles and difficulty levels (e.g,, easy, intermediate, difficult).**
*Create a menu bar for options such as "File" (~~"New Game"~~, "Reset Game", "Exit"), "Options", and "Help" (Use JMenuBar, JMenu, and JMenuItem classes).
*Create a status bar (JTextField at the south zone of BorderLayout) to show the messages (e.g., number of cells remaining) (google "java swing statusbar").
*Re-organize your codes. Apply your OO knowledge to factor out a class called GameBoard, which is a customized JPanel.
*Beautify your graphical interface, e.g., color, font, layout, etc.
***Timer (pause/resume), score, progress bar.**
*A side panel for command, display, strategy?
*~~Automatic puzzle generation~~ with **various difficulty level.**
*The sample program processes ActionEvent of the JTextField, which requires user to push the ENTER key. Try KeyEvent with keyTyped() handler; or other means that does not require pushing of ENTER key.
*Sound effect, background music, enable/disable sound?
*High score and player name?
*Hints and cheats (reveal a cell, or reveal all cells with number n)?
*Choice of display "theme"?
*Use of images and icons?
*(Very difficult) Multi-Player game through networking.
