- [x] Reset/Restart the game.
- [X] Use of images and icons?
- [X] Choice of puzzles and difficulty levels (e.g,, easy, intermediate, difficult).

- [X] Create a status bar (JTextField at the south zone of BorderLayout) to show the messages (e.g., number of cells remaining) (google "java swing statusbar").
- [ ] A good Sudoku engine shall accept any "valid" number at the time of input (no duplicate in row, column and sub-grid), but signal a conflict whenever it is detected. Highlight the conflicting cells.
- [ ] Beautify your graphical interface, e.g., color, font, layout, etc.
